  <h1><center> Question 3</center></h1><hr>
  <p>The use of cannabis originated in central Asia or western China. Cannabis has been used for its alleged healing properties for millennia. The first documented case of its use dates back to 2800 BC, when it was listed in the Emperor Shen Nung's (regarded as the father of Chinese medicine) pharmacopoeia.</p><br>
  <p>It is a <b> The cannabis or hemp plant originally evolved in Central Asia before people introduced the plant into Africa, Europe and eventually the Americas ...</b>. Historians believe that cannabis first came to the Americas in the mid-1550s when Spanish people decided to grow cannabis crops in the “New World.” In the mid 16th century, Spanish people started to grow cannabis crops for hemp, which they used to create the rigging of ships, clothing, and bags.</p><br>
  <p>How long has marijuana been on Earth? It has <i>Cannabis was attested to around 12 000 years ago near the Altai Mountains in Central Asia, and since then, cannabis seeds have accompanied the migration of nomadic peoples.</i>. Etymology. The term, originally spelled variously as "marihuana", "mariguana", etc., originated in Mexican Spanish. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term may come from the Nahuatl mallihuan, meaning "prisoner".</p><br>
  <p>The <u>Racist ideas spread associating marijuana and its perceived dangers with immigrants. By the 1930s, government drug warriors (most famously, Harry Anslinger) played on this through propaganda and conspiracy to raise public fear. This was a platform to assault the legality of cannabis. </u>Marijuana is often referred to through various street names, with 'weed' and 'pot' being the most common. Aside from those two names, there are multiple other slang terms that it goes by, such as 'Mary Jane', 'bud', 'ganga', 'herb', 'chronic', 'grass', 'dope', 'hash', 'trees', and lastly, 'hemp' "CHOCOLATE".</p><br>
  <p align="left">According to The Vedas, cannabis was one of five sacred plants and a guardian angel lived in its leaves. The Vedas call cannabis a source of happiness, joy-giver, liberator that was compassionately given to humans to help us attain delight and lose fear (Abel, 1980). It releases us from anxiety.

    The god, Shiva is frequently associated with cannabis, called bhang in India. According to legend, Shiva wandered off into the fields after an angry discourse with his family. Drained from the family conflict and the hot sun, he fell asleep under a leafy plant. When he awoke, his curiosity led him to sample the leaves of the plant. Instantly rejuvenated, Shiva made the plant his favorite food and he became known as the Lord of Bhang. Here's an Indian painting of Shiva drinking bhang.</p><br>
  <p align ="center">During the Middle Ages, soldiers often took a drink of bhang before entering battle, just as Westerners took a swig of whiskey. One story tells of the Sikh leader, Gobind Singh's soldiers being scared by an attacking elephant with a sword in his trunk. Terrified, the men nearly mutinied until Singh gave one courageous man a mixture of bhang and opium. The herbs gave him the strength and agility to slip under the elephant from below and kill him without endangering himself. This act of courage led Singh's men to victory over the enemy.

    Cannabis has been popular in India since the beginning of recorded history and is often taken as a drink. Nuts and spices, like almonds, pistachios, poppy seeds, pepper, ginger, and sugar are combined with cannabis and boiled with milk. Yogurt is also used instead of milk. For a demonstration of the preparation of bhang,</p><br>

  <p align="right">The British found the use of cannabis so extensive in colonial India that they commissioned a large scale study in the late 1890s (Iverson, 2008). They were concerned that the abuse of cannabis was endangering the health of the native people and driving them insane. The British government asked the government of India to appoint a commission to look into the cultivation of the hemp plant, preparation of drugs from it, trade in those drugs, the social and moral impact of its consumption, and possible prohibition.

    Over 1,000 standardized interviews were conducted throughout India by eminent British and Indian medical experts. The commission was systematic and thorough. It sampled a large and diverse group of people in a range of situations, from farmers to hospital psychiatrists.</p><br>
  <p align="justify"Cannabis continues to be available in India of the 20th and 21st centuries. In their review in the mid-fifties, Chopra and Chopra (1957) found little changed since the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report of 1894. Construction workers use bhang to feel refreshed at the end of the day and to fight fatigue. Hindus use bhang for religious ceremonies like Holi and ascetics use it to seek divinity. Sadhus are Indian ascetics who have shunned material life and use cannabis to seek spiritual freedom. They live simply in the forest and wear ragged clothing. By emphasizing physical austerity through celibacy and fasting, cannabis helps sadhus transcend ordinary reality and achieve transcendence.

  Today, bhang is so common in some parts of India that it can be found in government-licensed street stands. In sum, the herbal plant, cannabis, has a long and continuous history in India. It has lived for thousands of years in stories of gods and warriors and it continues to live today in religious ceremonies and street stands.</p><br>
